Football-Visualization

Football Visualization was developed to showcase the statistics of the Northwest Football team and players in the past ten years. The user can view the statistics and also understand the essence of numbers as all the stats are visualized and offer a greater impact of understanding. The users can also compare skills of players, compare players and compare players performance over the years.

All the data was processed using the cluster analysis in K-means algortihm. Football visualization was developed using ASP.NET MVC and since the database was highly unstructured, mongoDB was used. The database set up in mLab. For displaying highly interactive visualized charts, Highcharts library was added into the system. For displaying high-end and mobile compatible user interface, BootStrap was used.
